# Python Trojan

## Overview
This is a basic trojan written in Python that establishes a persistent connection with a remote server, listens for commands, and executes them on the infected machine. It autoruns by copying itself to the Windows startup folder and continuously tries to reconnect if the connection is lost. The script uses threading to execute commands concurrently.

## Features
- Persistent connection attempts to the attacker's server.
- Remote command execution.
- Multi-threaded execution to handle commands asynchronously.
- Low detectability by antivirus software when run

## Usage
1. Modify the IP (and, optionally, the port) of the code as needed.
   
2. Install the pyinstall library that will be used to generate the executable file:
   ```
   pip install pyinstall
   ```

3. Generate the executable:
   ```
   pyinstaller -F --clean -w trojan.py
   ```

Note: the file name can also be changed, as well as the icon. 

4. The attacker must leave a port listening on his machine to receive the connection:
   ```
   nc -lvp 443
   ```

Once the connection is received, the attacker will have persistent access to the victim's machine, thanks to the `autorun()` function, which ensures that the program is executed automatically whenever the system is started.


## Security Notice
Use this script only in controlled environments such as penetration testing labs, with explicit permission. Misuse of this tool for unauthorized access to systems is illegal and may result in severe consequences. The risk is yours.

## Observations
- The program has **low detectability** by antivirus software when run. But it is possible that, when generating the executable, the antivirus detects some suspicious activity, so I suggest disabling the antivirus/firewall when generating the executable to avoid errors.
- There is a risk that the victim may find the trojan in the Task Manager. If that happens, thereâ€™s nothing to do except attempt the connection again.
- Obviously, the victim must run the Trojan on Windows.
